# Hybrid Recommendation System: K-mean &Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization)

This project is part of my ongoing work on building a **Movie Recommendation System**.
In this phase, the goal is to **analyze and cluster users** from the [MovieLens 1M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) using **K-Means**.

## Current Phase

* Data preprocessing (ratings, users, movies merged).

* Feature engineering (genre & gender encoding, rating-weighted preferences).

* Feature scaling (occupation, age).

* K-Means clustering implemented from scratch.

* PCA visualization of clusters.

* Elbow method to select optimal K .

## Output

* Users grouped into 8 clusters.

* Cluster visualizations with centroids.

* User–Cluster mapping saved.

## Next Steps

* Implement Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization).

* Develop Hybrid Recommendation System (clustering + CF).
